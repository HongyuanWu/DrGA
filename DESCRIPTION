Description: DrGA is a novel R package that has been developed  
    based on the idea of our recent driver gene analysis scheme. 
    Its aim is to wholy automate the analysis process of driver 
    genes at a low investment of time for this process by 
    merging state-of-the-art statistical tools into one. 
    For further information on requirements as well as how to 
    implement this tool, please visit my Github repository:
